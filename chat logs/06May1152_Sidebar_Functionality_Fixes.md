# Sidebar Functionality Fixes

## Date: 06 May 2025, 11:52

## Major Themes Discussed
- Left sidebar navigation not working properly
- Right sidebar tab switching not functioning correctly
- Implementation of automated testing with Selenium

## Features Implemented
1. **Fixed Left Sidebar Navigation**
   - Removed the `custom` attribute from router-links
   - Added `.prevent` to click handlers to prevent default behavior
   - Ensured proper event propagation for navigation events

2. **Fixed Right Sidebar Tab Switching**
   - Updated the `switchSidebarTab` function to properly extract the view name from tab IDs
   - Added proper logging for debugging tab switching issues
   - Implemented error handling for invalid tab ID formats

3. **Automated Testing Framework**
   - Implemented a Selenium-based test script for automated UI testing
   - Created comprehensive tests for both sidebars' functionality
   - Added screenshot capabilities for visual debugging
   - Implemented detailed logging for test results

## Technical Details
- The left sidebar navigation issue was caused by the `custom` attribute on router-links, which prevented proper navigation
- The right sidebar tab switching issue was caused by the `switchSidebarTab` function not properly parsing the tab ID format
- The test script uses Selenium WebDriver to automate browser interactions and verify functionality

## Next Steps
1. Run the application with the fixes and manually verify that:
   - Left sidebar navigation links work correctly
   - Right sidebar tab switching functions properly
   - Both sidebars can be opened and closed without issues

2. Consider implementing additional tests for:
   - Edge cases in sidebar interactions
   - Mobile responsiveness testing
   - Performance testing for animations

3. Document the fixed functionality in the project's technical documentation

## Documentation Updates
- Updated the project with a new test directory containing Selenium tests
- Added a README.md file in the tests directory with instructions for running the tests
- Created this chat log to document the issues and fixes

## Additional Notes
- The Selenium test script can be run using `npm run test:sidebar` after starting the application
- Screenshots of test runs are saved in the `tests/screenshots` directory for debugging
- The test script is designed to be extensible for future UI testing needs
