+----------------------------------+
| {                                |
|   "selectedSongs": {             |
|     "red": ["song1", "song2"],   |
|     "folklore": ["song3"]        |
|   },                             |
|   "rankings": {                  |
|     "eras": ["folklore", "red"]  |
|   },                             |
|   "reviews": {                   |
|     "red": {                     |
|       "rating": 5,               |
|       "comment": "text",         |
|       "timestamp": "2025-05-05"  |
|     }                            |
|   }                              |
| }                                |
+----------------------------------+
```

This structure is accessed via the key 'music-besties-data' in the browser's LocalStorage. The application loads this data on startup and updates it when changes are made to rankings or reviews.

```
+----------------------------------+
| Responsive Layout Classes        |
+----------------------------------+
| Mobile (Default):                |
| - grid-cols-2                    |
| - p-4                            |
| - text-sm                        |
|                                  |
| Tablet+ (sm:):                   |
| - sm:grid-cols-3                 |
| - sm:p-6                         |
| - sm:gap-4                       |
+----------------------------------+
```

Key component-specific classes:
- `dashboard-grid-card`: Base styling for album cards
- `dashboard-stars`: Styling for star rating display
- `fixed inset-0`: Full-screen overlay for sidebar panels
- `max-w-sm`: Width constraint for sidebar on larger screens
- `bg-white shadow-xl`: Visual styling for panels
- `flex flex-col flex-grow`: Layout structure for tab containers
- `sticky top-14 z-10`: Positioning for fixed tab navigation

### 8.3. Data Flow Implementation

The application's data flow is implemented as follows:

```
+-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
| User Action | --> | Vue Methods | --> | State Update|
+-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
      |                                        |
      v                                        v
+-------------+                        +-------------+
| UI Update   | <----------------------| LocalStorage|
+-------------+                        +-------------+
```

Key methods involved in this flow include:
- `toggleItemRank()`: Updates ranking order when an item is tapped
- `saveAndExit()`: Persists changes to LocalStorage and returns to dashboard
- `setup()`: Initializes state from LocalStorage on component mount
- `updateReview()`: Saves review changes to LocalStorage

### 8.4. Interaction Implementation

The ranking functionality is implemented through click/tap handlers:

```
+----------------------------------+
| Ranking Interaction              |
+----------------------------------+
| Implementation:                  |
| - Click handler: toggleItemRank()|
| - State update: Updates array    |
|   order in currentSelectionOrders|
| - Visual feedback: Applies       |
|   .chip-rank-indicator class     |
|   with position number           |
+----------------------------------+
```

The star rating system is implemented using:
- Whole star characters (‚òÖ and ‚òÜ)
- Click handlers to set the rating value (1-5)
- Visual feedback showing the selected rating

### 8.5. Performance Considerations

For optimal performance when implementing new features:

1. Minimize DOM manipulations
2. Use Vue's reactive system for state changes
3. Implement proper cleanup in component unmount hooks
4. Leverage browser caching for LocalStorage data
5. Keep the bundle size small by avoiding unnecessary dependencies

By following these implementation guidelines, developers can maintain consistency with the existing codebase while ensuring the application remains performant and maintainable.
