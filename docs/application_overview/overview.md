## 2.2. Component Hierarchy

The application is structured around these key components, which are implemented in Vue.js:

**Figure 2.2.10: Component Hierarchy**

```
App.vue
  |
  |--- DashboardCard.vue (Multiple instances in grid)
  |
  |--- EditRankingsTabs.vue
  |      |
  |      |--- DraggableItem.vue (Multiple instances)
  |
  |--- SidebarPanel.vue
  |
  |--- ModalDialog.vue
```

*Tree diagram showing the Vue.js component inheritance and composition structure from App.vue down to individual UI elements. Helps developers understand component dependencies and the proper location for implementing new features or modifications.*

- **App.vue**: The root component that manages routing and global state
- **DashboardCard.vue**: Reusable component for album display on the dashboard
- **EditRankingsTabs.vue**: Container for the ranking interface with tabs
- **DraggableItem.vue**: Interactive component for selection functionality
- **SidebarPanel.vue**: Sliding panel for detailed album information
- **ModalDialog.vue**: Reusable dialog component for confirmations
